    <h1>Super vs Hyper</h1>

    <h3>Supercars</h3>
    <p>
       What is a <strong>Supercar</strong>:
        <pre>
    We would consider the definition of a supercar to be an eye catching
    factory stock car which accelerates faster and is more expensive
    than at least 98% of the other cars manufactured in the same year.
        </pre>

    <h3>Hypercars</h3>
    <p>
        The term <strong>hypercar</strong> seems to be used more and more each year.<br>
        We simply define a <b>hypercar</b> as a top-tier <i>supercar</i> that bests all or most of<br>
        the elements of standard <em>supercars</em> including, but not limited to, <u>acceleration</u>,<br>
        <u>price</u>, <u>rarity</u>, <u>handling</u>, top <sup>speed</sup>, <u>sound</u> and <u>appearance</u>.<br>
